## Folder Structure and Files 

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `src/main`: the folder to maintain source files
- `src/test`: the folder to maintain test files
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

There are three files in the `src/main` folder and in the `src/test` folder each: 

- `BankAccount.java` in the `src/main` folder

    This file contains the scaffolding for the `BankAccount` class. You need to implement the methods in this class. Details are provided as comments in the file.

- `BankAccountTest.java` in the `src/test` folder

    This file contains the tests for the `BankAccount` class. 
    After implementing the methods in the `BankAccount` class, all these tests should pass.

- `Vector.java` in the `src/main` folder

    This file contains the scaffolding for the `Vector` class. You need to implement the methods in this class. Details are provided as comments in the file.

- `VectorTest.java` in the `src/test` folder

    This file contains the tests for the `Vector` class. 
    After implementing the methods in the `Vector` class, all these tests should pass.

- `Main.java` in the `src/main` folder

    This file runs all the tests in the `BankAccountTest` and `VectorTest` classes to check if your implementations are correct.

## Q0. Setting up VS Code for Java development

To help you set up quickly, you can install the **[Coding Pack for Java]**, which includes VS Code, the Java Development Kit (JDK), and essential Java extensions. The Coding Pack can be used as a clean installation, or to update or repair an existing development environment.

* **[Install the Coding Pack for Java - Windows](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-win)**

* **[Install the Coding Pack for Java - macOS](https://aka.ms/vscode-java-installer-mac)**

Note: The Coding Pack for Java is only available for Windows and macOS. For other operating systems, you will need to manually install a JDK, VS Code, and Java extensions.

## Q1. Bank Account

There is a class `BankAccount` in the `src/main` folder. The class has the following attributes:

- `accountNumber` (String)
- `accountHolder` (String)
- `balance` (double)

Follow the instructions in the class to implement the methods.

## Q2. Vector

There is a class `Vector` in the `src/main` folder. The class has the following attributes:

- `n` (int)
- `data` (int[])

Follow the instructions in the class to implement the methods.
